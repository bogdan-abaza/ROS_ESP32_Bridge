This project provides an interface for an ESP32 microcontroller to communicate via serial with a computer running ROS (Robot Operating System). It enables precise motor control by generating PWM signals for the Pololu VNH5019 Motor Shield, allowing it to drive two motors.

This implementation is a streamlined adaptation of the Arduino ROS bridge by Josh Newans â€” special thanks for the original work! The PololuVNH5019MotorShieldESP32.cpp file has been fine-tuned specifically for the ESP32, building on the original Arduino implementation available here: Pololu dual-vnh5019-motor-shield.

Tested Configuration
Microcontroller: ESP32 NodeMCU-32S
Motor: NeveRest 40 Gearmotor with Encoder
This project simplifies integrating motor control into robotics projects, leveraging ROS for high-level control and the ESP32 for efficient motor handling.
